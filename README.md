Leveraging Generative AI by Using GAN's and DCGAN's to generate Synthetic Data and Images

#**Here's the process to generate Data using GAN's:**

1- Load and preprocess the dataset

2- Define the GAN: Create a generator model that generates new data and a discriminator model that distinguishes between real and fake data.

3- Train the GAN: Train both models in tandem until the generator produces realistic synthetic data.

4 - Generate synthetic data: Use the trained generator model to create new data.

5- Postprocess the synthetic data: If necessary, reverse any preprocessing steps (like normalization) on the generated data to bring it back to the original scale and format.

**(Using Basic GAN Model)**
